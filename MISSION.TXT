
[Mission01A]
It has come to our attention that there is
a city called @starthafen@ where very rare
goods are offered for purchase. Try to find
if this corresponds to the truth and bring 
the goods to @zielhafen@. You have time
until @zeit@.
[Mission01E]
By discovering @starthafen@ you have proved
your seafaring skills. We from the City Council
would like to thank you for your support by 
providing you with a new business in @bshafen@.
[Mission01F]
Unfortunately, you failed to solve the problem.
We have lost valuable time because of your
unsatisfactory performance. Do not expect a reward.
[Mission02A]
Great storm draws on @zielhafen@, so we
decided to fortify the port. We are now looking
for a brave man who will safely escort our ship
with the gold from @starthafen@ to @zielhafen@.
It has to be done by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission02E]
As a reward for your trouble you shall receive
a ship through which we give our thanks as well.
This ship can be found in @bshafen@. It is
now possible to build a large wall around
@zielhafen@ and the port will be safe then.
[Mission02F]
The money came too late. The storm raged
in the harbor and damaged many ships. We will
ask a more reliable Captain for their help next
time. Do not expect a reward for this mission!
[Mission03A]
Because of a long-lasting drought, the city of
@Zielhafen@ is plagued by a great famine.
We are looking for a courageous captain who will
supply @zielhafen@ with @objekt@ from @starthafen@.
Rest assured that such a noble act will be
generously rewarded. The city has to be
relieved before @zeit@.
[Mission03E]
Thanks to your quick intervention it was
possible to prevent the worst. The situation
in @zielhafen@ has now calmed down and you
have earned a reward of @longheld@ gold.
[Mission03F]
The food has gone bad. It is now no longer
possible for the town @zielhafen@ to get
the much needed help. Luckily, other captains
have not failed. Let this is to be a lesson to you.
[Mission04A]
A major fire has destroyed the harvest of
@zielhafen@ almost completely. It is
necessary to send a fleet with @objekt@ from
@starthafen@ to save the subjects of his
Majesty. You have time until @zeit@ and you shall
be paid generously if you can prevent the worst.
[Mission04E]
Glory and thanks be to you. You have freed
many starving people from their distress.
The Mayor of @zielhafen@ has awarded you with
a proud sum of @lohngeld@ gold in recognition
of your swift and generous help to the @zielhafen@.
[Mission04F]
Immediate assistance was needed for the
population of @zielhafen@. The food is
now spoiled. You must now pay the costs
of @strafegeld@ Gold for another delivery
from your own bag.
[Mission05A]
In @zielhafen@, an attack by the natives is
imminent. We ask you to escort reinforcements
to support the garrison forces to @zielhafen@
by the @zeit@ at the latest. Our ship is located
in @starthafen@ ready to sail.
[Mission05E]
Without your help hundreds of people would
have lost their lives. For the safe escort you
provided you shall be immediately awarded
a sum of @longheld@ gold.
[Mission05F]
Curse you! Much of our possessions were
destroyed due to your failure! We demand
you to pay the reparation of @strafegeld@ Gold!
[Mission06A]
The port of @Zielhafen@ has been haunted by
pirates for quite some time. Free the port
from this plague and destroy the infamous
@flotte@. As a reward, all the shipments and
@lohngeld@ Gold should be yours - if you
manage it before @zeit@.
[Mission06E]
A glorious battle! Finally, these pirates
met their just fate. Someone sent them to
the bottom of the sea! The reward of
@lohngeld@ Gold is hereby awarded to you.
[Mission06F]
If only we never called upon you! The
incidents are now worse than ever. You will
be punished for this failure. You are ordered
to pay a fine @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission08A]
We have found out that our enemies wants to
attack our city, @starthafen@. We call upon
a reliable captain to be richly rewarded,
who would evacuate some of the high-ranking
Noblemen to @zielhafen@ before @zeit@.
Discretion is of utmost importance.
[Mission08E]
We are impressed by your finesse. There is
no other captain that we could have trusted
with this vital task. A new ship is ready
for you at @bshafen@ - a gift in recognition
of your service.
[Mission08F]
The lowest of sailors could have done better
than you did. You are fined @strafegeld@ for
your incompetence and rest assured that your
reputation will be damaged by this failure.
Beware of the authorities!
[Mission09A]
Our loyal informers report that privateers
are planning an attack on @starthafen@. The
painting of the Holy Mother is currently
stationed there. Bring it to @zielhafen@
and deliver our warm thanks. We estimate
that the privateers  will attack by @zeit@
at the latest.
[Mission09E]
We are happy that you have taken such a
burden on you for the Holy Church. We shall
pray for your ethernal soul. We have no doubts
that the Absolution awaits you.
[Mission09F]
You pirate! You are bound to be working with
the others undercover! The portrait has still
not arrived. We expect a donation to the
church in an amount of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission10A]
His Majesty is deeply concerned. @Zielhafen@,
a key position in the expansionist policy of
His Majesty, must be won for us. We promise
a high reward for the fulfillment of this
contract. However the time you have available
is however limited, do so before @zeit@.
[Mission10E]
His Majesty was impressed by your handling of
the situation. You will be rewarded by having
your fort in @bshafen@ expansion financed
from Royal coffers.
[Mission10F]
His Majesty asked me to convey his immense
dissatisfaction at how you have handled the
affairs. His Majesty hereby issued a fine
of @strafegeld@ Gold that you are to pay
immediately to save your face.
[Mission11A]
The admiralty has learned that a dangerous
privateer is threatening the seas with his
armed fleet. Capture him and his ship, the
@schiff@, and make sure that he lives when
you bring him to @zielhafen@. He has to be
delivered before @zeit@. 
[Mission11E]
A faultless performance. This pirate had
cost us many lives. He will surely be known
as one of the worst plagues of the seas.
You will be awarded @lohngeld@ gold as a
reward and rest assured that your help will
be remembered.
[Mission11F]
Even the lowest urchin would acted honorably.
You are a disgrace of all captains. But as a
sign of our good will, we demand only a small
sum of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission12A]
The son of the ambassador, who is currently in
@starthafen@, must be safely and speedily
escorted to @zielhafen@ out of security reasons.
It is imperative that you shall do so by @zeit@
at latest. Make sure that he will not come to
any harm or worse.
[Mission12E]
We are very relieved about how discreetly have
you handled this delicate matter to our fullest
satisfaction. You shall be rewarded with
@lohngeld@ gold for your deeds.
[Mission12F]
We should have known better than to trust you
with this delicate matter! Be thankful that
our only compensation shall be a ship from
your fleet, and not your very life!
[Mission14A]
Our very own ruler needs your help! A strictly
secret State document must be handed by @zeit@
to @zielhafen@ Åsafely. You have to travel to
@starthafen@ to pick up the document. Third
parties are not allowed to see the contents
under any circumstances!
[Mission14E]
Masterfully done! We shall praise your name with
highest honors!. By delivering the document
a diplomatic fiasco has been avoided. As our
thanks, we shall equip your fleet at @bshafen@
with the best equipment!
[Mission14F]
Oh you damned fool! I cannot remember the last
time that someone failed us so miserably!. 
Your actions has cost us a substantial amount
of money, which you shall be paying from your
pocket, with dividends! We expect @strafegeld@
gold to be paid at once!
[Mission15A]
The @flotte@ of @land@ constantly blockades our
vital ports. Your late achievements show that
we can trust you with removing of this problem.
Make sure that the whole fleet sinks by @zeit@
and our thanks shall not only be in words.
[Mission15E]
It has come to our attention that the fleet has
been sunk! You have performed better than we
dared to hope. For this grand victory you shall
receive a reward of @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission15F]
You are a horrible failure! Because of your
deeds the population of the port has starved
for weeks!. To cover the damages, you shall
pay @strafegeld@ gold to the treasury.
[Mission16A]
The Silver Fleet in @starthafen@ awaits a
well armed protection fleet to escort her.
Hand over such a fleet by @zeit@ at
@zielhafen@ and your reward shall be huge.
[Mission16E]
The Royal Treasure is in great debt to you!
This delivery of @lohngeld@ gold awaits you
on the Stewards instruction.
[Mission16F]
Because of your failure, the Steward of our
king has been executed! But your failure was
not forgotten either! His Majesty expects
the sum of @strafegeld@ gold as a warning.
[Mission17A]
The Crown urgently needs ships. Prepare a
privateer fleet and go hunting in the name
of our country. Bring us a ship to @zielhafen@.
In the @flotte@ of @land@ should a proud
@schiff@ be found. This needs to be done by
@zeit@. You shall receive a rich bounty.
[Mission17E]
Your performance honors you! We are extremely
proud of you. His Majesty took on him to
equip for you a fleet in @bshafen@.
[Mission17F]
To make you think twice about trying failing
His Majesty, you shall be fined to pay
@strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission18A]
We were told about a port city called
@zielhafen@. Sail to this port and conquer
it for us by no later than @zeit@. The
thanks of His Majesty will be immeasurable.
[Mission18E]
You have fulfilled his Majesty's personal wish.
In his kindness, he grants you a shipyard
in @bshafen@.
[Mission18F]
You have greatly disappointed His Majesty.
In his righteous anger at your failure, he
had your shipyard in @bshafen@ seized
and burnt!
[Mission19A]
The Princess wishes to acquire a diadem from
@starthafen@. Find this port and bring the
diadem back to @zielhafen@. It would be
rather disappointing if you were to take longer
than until @zeit@.
[Mission19E]
His Majesty is extremely pleased with you.
Your fleet at @bshafen@ shall be equipped
at the Crowns expense.
[Mission19F]
His Majesty is enraged! Because of your failure,
the Princess has been put into an embarrassing
situation! The King confiscates one of your ships
in @bshafen@ and shall find a new Captain for
any future dealings.
[Mission20A]
Wanted is a man without fear and sin, who
shall carry a sizable sum of gold safely from 
@starthafen@ to @zielhafen@ to faciliate
the construction of a church. Such a task
will bring both spiritual and secular rewards.
The people of @zielhafen@ expect the gold
by @zeit@.
[Mission20E]
Thanks to your fast actions, we established
a new church of faithful in @zielhafen@.
To express our gratitude we would like you
to take this reward of @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission20F]
The people of @zielhafen@ are understandably
upset with this turn of events. They are
wondering where the gold has ended.
You are to return the gold immediately, with
a compensation for your failure added.
The sum of @strafegeld@ gold will at
least partially show your remorse.
[Mission21A]
The presence of a smuggler ship in the @flotte@
from @land@ has been reported to us several
times. We are looking for a daring Capitan able
to seize the ship and bring it to @zielhafen@
by @zeit@. The payment shall be immediate.
[Mission21E]
Finally! The damned ship is in our hands.
For this glamorous act you are being
rewarded with construction of a shipyard
in @bshafen@ immediately, and on the
expense of the Crown to boot!
[Mission21F]
Since you are here without the prey, you
are suspected to be in common cause
with the smugglers. To make sure of your
loyalty, your ship in @bshafen@ has been
seized for the Crown.
[Mission22A]
On his Majesty's orders, the port of @zielhafen@
is to be captured by no later than @zeit@ in
the name of the Crown. For this task, strong
men are sought, who shall take on this quest
for glory, honor and an earnest reward.
[Mission22E]
Your glorious deeds in this battle will always be
well remembered at court. We have noticed that
in @zielhafen@ there is no fortress standing.
Therefore, all means shall be used to provide
a well-equipped fortress in @bshafen@.
[Mission22F]
You have suffered a defeat to the shame
of our country. To alleviate the humiliation of
His Majesty, you should be severely
punished. We hereby announce that you
have to pay the sum of @strafegeld@ to
the Crown.
[Mission23A]
The seriously ill ambassador in
@starthafen@ should be granted a safe
crossing to @zielhafen@. The ambassador's
wish to be laid to rest in his homeland
requires that the crossing be made possible
by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission23E]
Since fulfilling the last wish of a terminally
ill person was worth the trip, a fleet will be
equipped in @bshafen@ as a thank
you for this noble deed.
[Mission23F]
Were you unable to fulfill the last wish
of a dying person? Such behavior certainly
does not help to increase your reputation.
[Mission24A]
A ready fleet is needed to transport
a load of fur coats from @starthafen@
to @zielhafen@ by @zeit@. The reward
will far exceed the effort.
[Mission24E]
The quick delivery of the goods made
it possible to achieve a good price.
Your share is therefore @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission24F]
Unfortunately, the goods have rotted.
As compensation, you have to pay
a replacement for the goods in
the amount of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission25A]
A gift from the prince in @starthafen@ for
the authorities in @zielhafen@ is to be
given safe passage. This is a proud ship
from his fleet. The prince will be truly
grateful if you bring it to its destination
by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission25E]
The successful completion of this mission
was of great importance for our country. As
a token of gratitude, you will be presented
with the proud sum of @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission25F]
His Majesty is outraged. Where has the proud
ship gone? In exchange for your life, we will
take a ship from your possession in @bshafen@.
[Mission26A]
@flotte@ of the enemy @land@ is causing us ever
greater difficulties. A captain who succeeds in
devastatingly defeating the enemy fleet within
@zeit@ will be assured of the gratitude of our
country. The reward will be appropriate for such
a great success.
[Mission26E]
A great victory has been achieved. The
destruction of the fleet has been reported
to us. Therefore, we will give you the proud
sum of @lohngeld@ gold as a reward.
[Mission26F]
You have severely weakened our country. To
express our displeasure for this disgrace,
we demand from you the sum of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission27A]
The Admiralty fears that their sailors are
becoming increasingly demoralized. The cause
is suspected to be the brazen actions of
a privateer. You must confront this pirate
and destroy his @flotte@. We will give you
until @zeit@ to do this.
[Mission27E]
Your heroic sea battle with the pirates has
restored the sailors' faith in justice. For
your or your allies' deeds, His Majesty is
ready to provide a reward of @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission27F]
Your failure has further weakened the morale
of our sailors. Now the captains must also
expect unrest and mutiny at any time. You
have not done your country a good service.
[Mission28A]
The governor of @starthafen@ has an escort order
for an unofficial transport to @zielhafen@. The
governor is known for his generosity. Don't
disappoint him! So that we don't lose too much
time, this should be done by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission28E]
I have been commissioned to transfer to you
a magnificent ship in the port of @bshafen@.
The governor was very pleased.
[Mission28F]
The governor has instructed me to inform you
that he expects appropriate compensation for
your amateurish work. According to his order,
you must pay a fine of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission29A]
Unrestful times have begun in @starthafen@.
The @objekt@ of @starthafen@ must be escorted
without delay with his court to the safety of
@zielhafen@. His Majesty is placing all his
hopes in you and is expecting his guests by
@zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission29E]
His Majesty is pleased with your performance.
He grants you his favor and grants you
a shipyard in the harbor of @bshafen@ in his name.
[Mission29F]
His Majesty turns away whenever your name
is mentioned. He gave the order to dismantle
a production facility in your possession
in @bshafen@.
[Mission30A]
A delicate task requires a discreet captain!
The concubine of an influential person must
be taken out of the country for reasons of
national security. Take her on board at
@starthafen@ and bring her safely to
@zielhafen@. She is expected there by
@zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission30E]
I have been instructed to give you
a bag of @lohngeld@ gold. They were
very pleased with you.
[Mission30F]
My master instructed me to inform you that
he expects a fair compensation for your
miserable work. His idea was @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission31A]
@land@ has declared war on us! Our sovereign
needs a well-equipped war fleet to attack his
most important ports. Your mission is to conquer
@zielhafen@ by @zeit@. You must not fail!
The well-being of our country depends on it.
[Mission31E]
His Majesty is pleased with you. Expect future
orders in this matter. A small compensation
in advance in the amount of @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission31F]
Our ruler realizes that he has overtaxed you.
You are dismissed from his service, but he
decides to confiscate one of your ships in
the harbor on @bshafen@ for further combat.
[Mission32A]
There is an enemy port that you must conquer
for the crown. @zielhafen@ is heavily fortified.
If you are victorious by @zeit@ at the latest,
the government will surely be grateful.
[Mission32E]
His Majesty smiles at the mention of your
name. It is an honor for us to entrust you
with a ship in the port of @bshafen@.
[Mission32F]
His Majesty is extremely displeased. His will
is to impose a fine of @strafegeld@ gold on you.
[Mission33A]
@flotte@ from @land@ has been giving us more
and more trouble lately. Set sail and put
an end to this nightmare. You have until @zeit@
to do so. A generous reward awaits you.
[Mission33E]
The enemy has been considerably weakened by
you or your allies! His Majesty is holding
a great feast in your honor and in his
generosity he is presenting you with a sum
of @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission33F]
His Majesty's disappointment knows no
bounds! He is demanding from you the sum
of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission34A]
The Admiralty needs a well-equipped fleet to
ship a food supply. You must report at @starthafen@
and from there take @objekt@ to @zielhafen@.
You have until @zeit@ to complete this task.
[Mission34E]
You have done your country and His Majesty
a great service. We show our gratitude for
your services with @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission34F]
You have failed! To obtain the missing food,
®we expect compensation in the amount
of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission35A]
A spy with a very important document has
been captured in @starthafen@. Bring this
document to @zielhafen@ as quickly as possible.
If you take longer than @zeit@ to do so, this
document will lose all use for the crown.
[Mission35E]
You have rendered His Majesty an invaluable
service. In return you shall receive a ship
in the port of @bshafen@.
[Mission35F]
Important information has become useless to the
crown due to your negligence. As punishment, one
of your ships in @bshafen@ will be confiscated by
His Majesty. Next time, assess your capabilities
more realistically!
[Mission36A]
Recently, individual ships of the @flotte@
have been sighted from @land@, spying on our
fortresses. Bring the @schiff@ up and hand
over the captain to us in @zielhafen@ by @zeit@
at the latest. Alive!
[Mission36E]
You have handed over the captain to us.
Thanks to your actions, the crown now has
important information at its disposal. As
a token of our appreciation, take this
box containing @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission36F]
Unfortunately, we no longer have any way
of finding out what happened to the scout
ship. I hope for your sake that your failure
will not cause any greater damage.
[Mission37A]
As we have been informed by a reliable source,
the @schiff@ has left @land@. This ship was
stolen from an influential person a few months
ago. Please hand the ship over to us by @zeit@
at the latest in @zielhafen@.
[Mission37E]
Tempers have calmed down again and people
in higher circles are very satisfied.
Therefore, it has been decided to grant you
a reward of @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission37F]
Your failure has inflamed some tempers. To calm
them down, you are expected to make amends in
the amount of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission39A]
The Holy Church has a request. It wishes to
allow a highly worthy clergyman to travel from
@starthafen@ to @zielhafen@ by @zeit@ at the
latest. Make his journey as pleasant as possible.
[Mission39E]
His Eminence has spoken of you in the most
benevolent tones. We would like to show our
gratitude for this courtesy on your part
with this bag filled with @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission39F]
You are not even capable of carrying out
such a simple task. No amount of gold in
the world will compensate us for this loss,
but rest assured of this! You have put your
soul's salvation on the line.
[Mission40A]
His Majesty the Prince has seen a portrait
of a beautiful girl from @starthafen@. You
are now to bring this noble maiden to him.
Go there as quickly as possible and bring
her to @zielhafen@ by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission40E]
The prince ordered the expansion of the fortress
in @bshafen@. You have made two people very happy.
[Mission40F]
You are not human, you are the devil himself!
How could you allow the maid not to arrive on
time? In his pain, the prince has the fortress
in @bshafen@ burned down.
[Mission41A]
Since @zielhafen@ has run out of fur coats,
you must hurry to bring new fur coats to the
poor freezing people from @starthafen@. They
probably won't last much longer than @zeit@.
[Mission41E]
Since the poor freezing people in @zielhafen@
now have warm hearts and you have fulfilled
your task, we grant you the favor of equipping
one of your fleets in @bshafen@.
[Mission41F]
Since the population in @zielhafen@ is now
freezing even more, one of your ships in the
harbor @bshafen@ will be chopped into small
pieces, transported to @zielhafen@ and used as firewood.
[Mission42A]
We have heard that citizens of our country
are being forced into shameful forced labor in
@zielhafen@. Go there with a well-equipped war
fleet and put an end to this shameful activity
by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission42E]
You are a hero! Hundreds of citizens freed
from cruel bondage have signed a petition
demanding that the fortress in @bshafen@ be
expanded according to our discretion.
[Mission42F]
If we were you, we would move our sphere
of influence to another body of water.
The angry relatives of the poor enslaved
souls that you could not free are running
amok. Deposit @strafegeld@ gold with us and
we will know how to calm the masses.
[Mission43A]
One of the cruelest pirates has been freed from
his dungeon in @land@. He is now making the
region unsafe with his fearsome @schiff@ from
the @flotte@. Hand the monster over to the
minions in @zielhafen@ by @zeit@. You will not
regret you support.
[Mission43E]
Praise the Lord! Thanks to you, we have gotten
rid of another scourge of the seas. We would
like to show our gratitude with this little
chest filled with @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission43F]
What a shame, what a disgrace! How could you
fail us like that? One of your ships in
@bshafen@ should ease our disappointment
a little. You may withdraw.
[Mission44A]
A ship with valuable jewelry is waiting for
your escort in @starthafen@. Accompany it
and bring it safely to @zielhafen@ before @zeit@.
You will be rewarded handsomely.
[Mission44E]
Thanks to your escort, the ship arrived safely
at @zielhafen@. For this you will be rewarded
handsomely with @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission44F]
Since your failure has caused us considerable
damage, you are responsible for this damage
with your assets. You will therefore be
deprived of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission45A]
In @zielhafen@ the lands are constantly being
attacked by natives. Travel to @starthafen@,
take soldiers on board and go to @zielhafen@
to support the population. You have until
@zeit@ to complete your task.
[Mission45E]
By completing your task excellently, you have
acquired a new production facility in @bshafen@.
Use it diligently to achieve further prosperity.
[Mission45F]
Since you were unable to complete the task
assigned to you, one of your production
facilities in @bshafen@ was burned down by
the greater power. This should always
remind you not to be negligent in fulfilling
accepted orders.
[Mission46A]
The enemy has become too powerful for us. Equip
a war fleet and attack our enemies in @zielhafen@
by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission46E]
Despite your losses, you managed to keep our
opponents in check. As a token of our gratitude,
we will expand the fortress in the port of @bshafen@.
[Mission46F]
Since, despite your strength, you have not
succeeded in weakening the enemy and breaking
his power, the fortress in @bshafen@ will be
®burned down as punishment.
[Mission47A]
A close associate of Her Majesty has revealed
himself to be an evil scoundrel and spy. He set
sail from a port in @land@ with the @flotte@.
Capture the @schiff@, place this subject in
chains and bring him to @zielhafen@. We expect
your return by @zeit@.
[Mission47E]
Thanks to your ingenuity and daring, we are now
able to set an example. Your achievement should
be worth a new production facility in @bshafen@.
[Mission47F]
We really have to ask ourselves what has gotten
into you? How dare you come before our eyes
again after such a ridiculous performance? We
demand a ship in @bshafen@ as compensation from
you. Now get out of our sight.
[Mission48A]
The governor of @starthafen@ has given us
a bronze statue as a gift. Go there immediately
and collect the statue. Then bring it straight to
@zielhafen@. In order not to endanger diplomatic
relations, you must not take longer than @zeit@
to do this.
[Mission48E]
You have completed the task to our complete
satisfaction. You will be paid @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission48F]
We can only hope that the political
complications you have caused will
not have major consequences. As
compensation for your incompetence,
we expect the sum of @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission49A]
You must save the ambassador from @starthafen@
from the mob. Bring him to the safety of
@zielhafen@. Hurry up, because time is short.
He must arrive there by @zeit@ at the latest.
[Mission49E]
The rescue was successful! You can be sure
of our thanks and our appreciation. A shipyard
will be built for you in the port of @bshafen@.
[Mission49F]
An important man was not in his place when he
was urgently needed. The consequences are not
yet foreseeable. For this disgrace and uncertainty,
the shipyard in @bshafen@ should be looted.
[Mission50A]
Since you are known for your secrecy, you are
to bring a secret document from the governor in
@starthafen@ to the Grand Inquisitor in
@zielhafen@. Since the matter is of great
urgency, you only have until @zeit@ to
complete it.
[Mission50E]
The governor's praise and thanks are to be
conveyed to you. As a reward for your
efforts, I am to give you this bag of
@lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission50F]
The governor is furious and is demanding
your removal. However, we were able to
appease him with a sum of gold. Therefore,
you must now pay us @strafegeld@ gold.
[Mission51A]
The tax revenue from @starthafen@ was unusually
high. Since the capacity of our tax collector's
ship is insufficient, you are requested to bring
the rest of the taxes to @zielhafen@. You will
be given until @zeit@ to do this.
[Mission51E]
Since the crown is now free of many financial
worries, you should also benefit from the taxes.
As a thank you, you will receive @lohngeld@ gold.
[Mission51F]
You have caused great financial damage to
the crown. If you wish to escape the debtor's
tower, then immediately hand over @strafegeld@
gold to the treasurer.
[Mission52A]
We have a transport of prisoners in @starthafen@
that must be escorted to @zielhafen@ to take
the men there for forced labor. Since these
workers are already desperately awaited, you only
have until @zeit@ to escort them.
[Mission52E]
Your reputation precedes your actions.
No privateer seems to be a match for your
cannons. Due to the low loss of convicts
and the quick transfer, we grant you
the favor of a new ship in the port
of @bshafen@.
[Mission52F]
Your failure tempts us to send you into forced
service instead of the convicts. But you
graciously only owe us one ship. Therefore,
we will take one of your ships in the port
of @bshafen@. Settle this bill and we will
let you go.
[Mission53A]
One of our ports has been increasingly attacked
by the enemy from @land@ recently. The completely
intimidated population needs your help as soon
as possible. You must have found the enemy by
and sunk his @fleet@ by @zeit@.
[Mission53E]
Well done! We've been told that someone has
wiped out the fleet. A celebration will be
held in your honor. And this impressive purse
of @lohngeld@ gold will be yours.
[Mission53F]
What a disgrace, what a loss of face! Get out
of my sight! No! Stop! Know then that we will
accept the sum of @strafegeld@ gold as
compensation. Now remove yourself from here!
[Mission54A]
There is a shipment of rare and select fur coats
in @starthafen@ that urgently needs to be
transported to @zielhafen@. We hope that you will
be able to deliver these precious furs before
they become moldy. We will give you until
@zeit@ to do so.
[Mission54E]
We are very grateful to you. This letter
of recommendation is evidence of a satisfied hand.
We can therefore assume that you have successfully
delivered your cargo. One of your fleets in
@bshafen@ will be equipped from our stocks.
[Mission54F]
You have failed! My friend's sour letter
testifies to your outrage against high
society. You will pay for the loss! Pay
the steward @strafegeld@ gold and then
get out of our sight.
[Mission55A]
The daughter of the ambassador of @zielhafen@
has been kidnapped. The maiden is threatened
with murder if a ransom is not handed over by
@zeit@. If you rescue the tormented woman within
this time period, you will receive a reward.
The ransom is waiting for you in @starthafen@.
[Mission55E]
Thanks to your help, the maiden returned
safely to her parents' protection.
The promised sum of @lohngeld@ gold will
now be handed over to you.
[Mission55F]
We can thank the Lord that the kidnappers
agreed to double the ransom after your rescue
attempt. We naturally expect this sum back from
you. It amounts to exactly @strafegeld@ gold.
[STDLOHN]
We are extremely satisfied with your help.
For this you shall be awarded @lohngeld@ gold.
[STDSTRAFE]
We simply can not believe that such a renowned
man is capable of such a miserable feat.
As an punishment, you shall pay a sum of
@strafegeld@ gold.
[stdpleite]
Your performance was anything but satisfactory.
You will be always haunted by contempt of
your peers. Better luck next time!
