[Die Brigg]
Brig
[Erklaerung Brigg]
Brig|an|tines, Snow|ships and Brigs are two-|mast|ed
Ships with tri|an|gu|lar sails on the Rah. They are
above all fast-|sailing and sui|tab|le for es|cor|ting,
il|le|gal ac|ti|vi|ti|es or re|con|nais|sance on short
dis|tan|ces. They are par|ti|cu|la|rly va|lued for
their speed and agility.
[Die Korvette]
Corvette
[Erklaerung Korvette]
Cor|vet|tes are more or less small|er Fri|ga|tes.
In spite of their small|er size they are per|fect
for war|fare. They can be used for re|con|nais|sance,
guard|ing, accom|pa|ny|ing other ships and also as couriers.
It is often the Cor|vet|tes that the mer|chant|s
would like to carry out and expand their co|lo|ni|al con|quest|s.
[Die Fregatte]
Frigate
[Erklaerung Fregatte]
Frigates are primarily used for the protection of merchant
ships and for tracking and pursuit of enemy ships. Due to
their good sailing qualities and their substantial combat
value, they were used to intimidate and suppress colonial
people and to combat piracy.
[Die Fleute]
Flute
[Erklaerung Fleute]
The Flute, or Fluyt, developed by the Dutch shipbuilders, is
unlike the Galleon a purely merchant ship. Its outstanding
efficiency made a significant contribution to the rise of
Dutch seafaring. It has become a model for the construction
of merchant ships in all European shipyards.
[Die Galeone]
Galleon
[Erklaerung Galeone]
Galleons are regarded as defensive trade and war vessels.
They were used by the Spaniards to transport the silver
and gold from the American colonies. But the British
and the Dutch also put their trust in the galleons,
who in well-equipped trading fleets can travel with
no fear of any opponent.
